# Dilemma-Submission
## Here is our submission for dilemma.


This project comprises of many small projects  we were able to come up with and make in the time span of 36 hours which was the duration of our first ever hackathon that is SYNTAX-ERROR.

We have used HTML,CSS,JS and their libraries(p5.js,THREE.js).


The projects that we have compiled here are -

##1. Tic-Tac-Toe 
we designed this tic-tac-toe from the very scratch. starting with generating random positions for the computer to play its move, further we refined it by implementing the MINIMAX algorithm which finds the best move for the computer to make sure the human player never wins.


##2. Bacardi-31 
This is the card game against computer in which both the players have to choose cards and there total sum is recorded,The first pllayer to make the sum to exceed the limit loses.The player who makes the first move can always wim by playing optimally. GGOD LUCK FINDING THE OPTIMAL MOVES :).


##3. Ascii-Art 
This is an out of the box project which creates your real-time video in terms of ASCII characters and Brightness Mirrors instead of pixels. you can vary the resolutions and also switch between the ASCII art and the Brightness Mirrors.


##4. Weather
This a web app which uses API(current wether) provided by openweather.com to fetch and display the temperaure of a particular place as well as many other parameters related to climate.


##5. To Do List
this is our first project that could have used databases and backend and we completed the required front-end but due to lack of time could not implement the back-end.
WE HOPE YOU CLEAR YOUR TO DO LIST


##6.BACKGOUND_ANIMATIONS
Now the easter egg of our project for which we really worked hard are the background animations which use 3d graphics and motion we also pragrammed collisions and astonishing animations to create soothing effects.

In the making of the project we came up with several new ideas and tried our best to implement them with all our technical knowledge and skills.

HOPE YOU LIKE IT!
